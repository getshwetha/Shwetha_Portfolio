									 	<h3>Objective</h3>
									<p>  To analyze the ORCHID dataset and to increase transplant opportunities for patients by enhancing the procurement process.
									</a>.</p>
									

								

											<h3>Background</h3>
											<ul>
												<p>Organ transplantation is a life-saving procedure for patients with advanced or end-stage diseases.This process is managed regionally by 56 organ procurement organizations (OPOs), in collaboration with the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) and six OPOs, they have obtained the first ever multi-centre dataset on organ procurement. .</p>
												
											</ul>

											

											<h3>Cleaning</h3>
											<ul>
												<li> For all the event tables we have retained the one latest reading for the day for each patient.</li> 
												<li>Deleted multiple values of the same test conducted on the same day.</li> 
												<li>Since the latest values are more significant for analysis we decided to drop these rows.</li>  
												<li>Rounded values to 2 digits in events tables for consistency and readability.</li>
												<li> Maintained time event end and removed time event start and represented it as a single time event for easier interpretation, analysis and tracking of results in the events table.</li>
													
												
													
												
											</ul>

											
											<h3>Insights</h3>
											<ul>
												<p>
													<li>Out of all referred cases, OPOs approached almost 14.69% of the cases. The remaining 85.35% were not approached by the donor's family for legal consent.</li> 
													<li>OPO3 is highly efficient in approaching organ donors </li>
													<li> OPO3 has shown consistent increase over years from 6.7% to 10.96% </li>
													<li>Out of all procured cases, 80% of cases are because of brain death . 20% not from brain death cases.</li>
