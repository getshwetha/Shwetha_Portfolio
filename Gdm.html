										<h3>Introduction</h3>						
									
									<ul>
									<p> Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy and usually disappears after giving birth. It occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin to meet the increased needs during pregnancy. This leads to higher blood sugar levels, which can pose risks to both the mother and baby if not managed properly.</p>

											<h3>Cleaning</h3>
											<ul>
												<li> Eliminated duplicate columns from the dataset to enhance data integrity and improve analysis accuracy by ensuring unique and relevant information is retained, reducing redundancy and potential inconsistencies.</li> 
												<li>Eliminated columns containing over 60% null values to enhance data quality and ensure a more reliable dataset for analysis..</li> 
												<li>Eliminated columns deemed unnecessary for achieving our objectives to enhance data relevance and improve analysis efficiency.</li>  
												<li>Columns containing both date and text values were separated into distinct 'date' and 'text' columns for clarity..</li>
												<li> Null values in lab-related columns were replaced with their respective mean values to ensure data consistency.</li>
												<li> Inaccurate entries like 'NO' and 'N0' were corrected to 'No', while 'yes' was standardized to 'Yes'. Null values were replaced with 'Not recorded' to ensure data consistency and to handle Data Entry Errors..</li>
